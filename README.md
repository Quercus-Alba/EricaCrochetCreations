# Erica's Crochet Creations webdesign
This webdesign was developed for a family member who makes crochet products

### This is a Codecademy Flexbox Challenge Project
The project required the use of flexboxs to design and build the layout for a company web page.  This webdesign actually has two web pages: the first page meets the requirements of this project and the second "Project" page was a specification from family member for a table that list projects and shows an image of each project in the table.  The web pages, header, and table were designed to be responsive to the size of the viewing screen (e.g., desktop, laptop, pad, phone).  The webdesign also incorporates JavaScript (JS) for the table row length.  The number of table rows that display can be resized by changing a variable in the JS code.

The resource file contains a Specs folder with a document in various formats that show the webdesign color scheme and fonts. Adobe Photoshop was used to create the logo.

### This webdesign uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the following features:
- Multiple page webdesign with responsive flat navigation menus
- Menu options respond to both hover and click responces
- Flexbox and grid design are used to make the webpage responsive to screen size
- @media only screen ... is used to resize and center header, menu options, and text
- Table is shown on the "Project" web page that is responsive to screen size
- The table is limited to four rows (as shown) but the number of rows shown can be set in a JS variable
- The table shows three columns but accomodates any number of columns in the table section
- The table scrolls and if the page is smaller than the table, both table and page scroll
- Resource folder has Specs folder with documents showing color scheme and fonts used in project
